## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alpha10-1/Organization_management_system.git
cd Organization_management_system
```

---

## Backend Setup (FastAPI)

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then set SECRET_KEY in .env, e.g.:
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Without a `SECRET_KEY`, the app still runs in development (it generates a
temporary one and warns you), but every restart invalidates existing logins.
Setting `ENVIRONMENT=production` without a real `SECRET_KEY` will refuse to
start at all.

### Run backend

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

---

## Frontend Setup (Next.js)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:
`http://localhost:3000`
